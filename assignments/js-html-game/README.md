The game is 2-player tic-tac-toe. 

The objective is to get three in a row in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal pattern. Starting with X's, players take turns marking a cell on the gameboard until there is a winner. When the gameboard is filled with no winner, it is a tie.

Players can use the restart game button to clear the board and initiate a new game.
